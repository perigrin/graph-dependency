=head1 NAME

Graph-Dependency - Generate dependency graphs for a Perl package.

=head1 INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test

=head1 REQUIRES

You need the following:

	Perl			(well, duh!)
	wget			(to acceess search.cpan.org)
	Module::CoreList
	Graph::Easy		(for the graphs)
	graphviz		(for png output)

=head1 USAGES

	./graph	YAML
	./graph Graph::Easy html
	./graph Graph::Easy png svg html

The output will be written to C<out/Foo-Bar/>. The META.yml
file for each module will be written to C<tmp/>.

=head1 BUGS

=over 10

=item *

The META.yml files are cached, but there is no mechanism to invalidate
or re-validate them. If you want to refresh the data, delete everything
in C<tmp/>.

=item *

Modules without a META.yml file will not generate dependencies. Parsing
of Makefile.PL is not implemented yet.

=item *

Modules that are in the core of I<any> Perl version are marked as "in-core".
If you have an older Perl, you might still need to install that module
first to satisfy the dependencies.

=item *

Getting the author name from the package requires a needless trip to
L<http://search.cpan.org> and might even fail. It would be cool
(I<*wink*> I<*nudge*>) if search.cpan.org could redirect to the proper
file when given:

	http://search.cpan.org/src/FOO-BAR/META.yml
